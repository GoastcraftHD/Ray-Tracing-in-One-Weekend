# Ray-Tracing-in-One-Weekend
As the name suggests, this project is based on the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) series.<br>
I have modified the code quite a bit and added:<br>
* Multithreading
* [stb image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) (to export png images)
* ... more to come
